                    <h4>1. Preface</h4>
                    <p>
                        I used to sketch/doodle a lot in high school and took traditional art classes in college for my digital media degree.
                        I eventually focused on programming, and while I still found creative outlets in my adult life, drawing wasn't a focus. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then at the end of February 2025, I decided to spend at least 10 minutes a day sketching. 
                        When I was deciding what I was going to sketch, I had recently returned to Magic: the Gathering (MTG) after about a ~4-year hiatus. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a website called <a href="https://scryfall.com/" target="_blank" title="scryfall">scryfall.com</a>, which is a search engine for every card in the game.
                        It has a dedicated button for pulling up a randomized card, which you can also access at <a href="https://scryfall.com/random" target="_blank" title="scryfall/random">scryfall.com/random</a>.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, I decided to hit the random button for each sketch, focusing on <span class="toolTip" title="cards that represent various different flavors of monsters that fight for the player">creature cards</span> as I mostly sketched figures.
                        After a month, I increased the time to 20 minutes. 
                        And as I approached the third month, I wanted to figure out what would be the next step.                  
                    </p>
                    <a class="jumpToTop" href="">Jump to Top</a>
                    <div id="abt2"></div>
                    <h4>2. An Altered Commander Deck</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since I had about 60 creature cards, I decided to create a Commander deck out of them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Commander is a 100-card variant of MTG where you cannot play duplicate cards (aside from basic <span class="toolTip" title="cards that generate the resource used to cast your non-land cards">lands</span> and cards that specifically note that you can play more than one).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While I could just add 40 basic lands and be done with it, I wanted the deck to be somewhat playable. 
                        The plan is to continue pulling random cards from some of the major categories of deckbuilding.
                        I will be pulling more than the recommended amount for each category, then trimming the entire stack down to 100.
                    </p>
                    <a class="jumpToTop" href="">Jump to Top</a>
                    <div id="abt3"></div>
                    <h4>3. * (Asterisk)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The asterisk in title of the project refers to the deck building process in two ways: 
                        </p>
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>
                                First, as mentioned, I am not hitting random 100 times in total. 
                                That deck has a high probability to be wildly imbalanced and not my idea of a "good time" in Commander.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Second, I have chosen seven cards specifically to try to hold the deck together.
                                Six of these cards are to match <span class="toolTip" title="a theme of deck centered around one ore more creature types">typal</span> synergy between all the cards.
                                The seventh is a land that allows all lands to produce any <span class="toolTip" title="basic property of cards">color</span> at the later stages of the game.
                            </li>
                        </ol>    
                    <p>
                        Note that currently I am still in the middle of randomly generating cards, so a synergy may still arise from the chaos.
                        So, while the current plan would have 93 random cards and 7 non-random cards, this could change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, I could always expand the card pool if I am still drawing past the project's original scope.
                    </p>

                    <div id="abt4"></div>                  
                    <h4>4. Categories</h4>
                    <p>
                        The following categories are the different filters that I will be using on scryfall:
                    </p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li><b>creatures (60):</b> The bulk of the sketches are creatures. The <span class="toolTip" title="a commander is also a designation to describe the central card of a Commander deck">commander</span> is currently <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m15/211/sliver-hivelord" target="_blank">Sliver Hivelord</a>, which <span class="toolTip" title="a Commander deck can only have colors that match the designated commander card for the deck">allows the use of every color</span>.</li>
                        <li><b>ramp (14?):</b> Adds to mana production. I am thinking of doing at least two weeks of sketches.</li>
                        <li><b>removal (14?):</b> Disrupting your opponent's plans through cards that would remove their <span class="toolTip" title="cards or tokens that exist on the battlefield"">permanents</span>. Ideally would have targeted and mass removal. Also thinking of doing two weeks for this section.</li>
                        <li><b>card advantage (14?):</b> Cards that draw cards. Not necessarily replacing itself, but give a positive card exchange, i.e. casting 1 card lets you draw 2+ cards. Two weeks for this one as well.</li>
                        <li><b>land (21? + basics):</b> I'm hoping to get a lot of <span class="toolTip" title="non-basic land that produces two colors of mana">dual lands</span>, so giving it three full weeks, but I will be randomizing art for each of the six basic land types to help fill in gaps if/when needed.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>5. Digital Drawings</h4>
                    <p>
                        While this started off with sketches, I ultimately would like to digitally paint each of these cards as well. 
                        Pictures I took of each sketch didn't scan well, so I thought about inking.
                        However, after playing around in Clip Studio Paint, I liked how much more the art popped when applying an MTG card frame around it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Digital painting takes a considerable amount of time, and I do not want to burn out, so I'll be limiting paints to a max of three a week.
                        The "Current Full Card Progress" at the top of this blog is how many full-card paints I have done. 
                        This might not reflect the number of paintings I have posted.
