This project started when I wanted to start drawing again. After watching a few videos with my partner, we decided to draw each day for 10 minutes to start. For my inspiration, I went to scryfall, a search engine for Magic: The Gathering, a game that I have played on and off since college. On the landing page of scryfall, there is a button for "Random Card". But as I continued, I learned to use the search filters to limit the randomness to creature cards, as the first few days randomized into creatures, and I enjoyed characters as the focus.
