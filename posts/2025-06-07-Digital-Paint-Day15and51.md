# Digital Art: Day 15's Fury and Day 51's Avatar of Fury
## Digital Paint: May 4, 2025

3rd digital drawing I've done for my random commander deck project.

On Day 15 of my project, I rolled a card named "Fury". Then on Day 51, I got one named "Avatar of Fury". Related? Other than both being red creatures... no. So, I decided to put them together, Yu-gi-oh-summoning style. That way, you can see parts of both creatures on each individual's card. Two birds and stone and what not.
