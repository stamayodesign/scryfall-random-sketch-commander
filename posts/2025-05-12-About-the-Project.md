# Site Update!
## About the Project Page, May 12, 2025

I've added an [About the Project](https://stamayodesign.github.io/scryfall-random-sketch-commander/html/about.html) page to the blog!

I go over how I came up with the project (expanding on the introductory post), how I'm going about randoomizing category of cards, and what the * in the header is all about.
