# AN INTRODUCTORY POST
## A "short" introduction, May 7, 2025

Hello! I've decided to go back to my digital media roots and make a website for a new project: ***Scryfall Random\* Sketch Commander***. I'll get to the asterik in a later post.

On Feburary 26, 2025, I decided to get back into drawing by spending at least 10 minutes sketching something. I chose to use scryfall.com, a search engine for Magic: the Gathering cards, to find inspiration. They have a feature where you can pull up a random card from their database. The first few days were creatures, so I decided to just do creature cards that came up.

After 30 days, I increased the amount of time drawing to 20 minutes. As I got closer to day 60, I decided that I wanted to create a commander deck.

Days 61-67 were non-random cards I chose to be added to make the deck work more cohesively with the only WUBRG commander option, Sliver Hivelord, as I only had one sliver in the deck.

For Days 68+ I will randomize ramp cards (-creature) for a certain amount of time. I don't know how many of these I will do, as other categories could cross-over, but I think I will end up making cuts for these categories anyways.
