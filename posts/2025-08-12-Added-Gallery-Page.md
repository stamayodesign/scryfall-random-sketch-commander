# Gallery Page for Sketches
## Site Update, August 12, 2025

Been a bit since I posted. Was focusing on coding the card gallery when I suddenly became sick and needed a week of bedrest.

Still not at 100%, but the good thing about taking a break in the middle of coding is that you can come back with fresh eyes. And now, I have a gallery to present: [The Cards](https://stamayodesign.github.io/scryfall-random-sketch-commander/html/cardgallery.html)

The gallery has all <b>159 sketches</b> with a filter at the top for different card types and card categories (ramp, card-advantage, etc.).

You can also find that the link in the menu bar is finally active!
