# Digital Art: Season of Gathering
## Digital Paint: June 15, 2025

I wanted to recreate the wooden stained style of the original piece, so I tried a different technique in clip studio paint. Thinking of applying it to more of my later sketches that are heavier in line strokes and not restricted to a timer, as I am starting to like the vibe of keeping most of the sketch intact. 

I also finished all my sketches, coming out to 159 in total, and with this technique, I feel like I could get to all of them. So, 151 more to go!
